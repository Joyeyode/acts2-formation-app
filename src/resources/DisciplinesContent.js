      heading: 'What Are Spiritual Disciplines?',
      content: 'Disciplines are intentional practices that create space for the Holy Spirit to form Christ in you. They\'re not legalistic rules, but life-giving rhythms. Dallas Willard called them "activities within our power that we do to enable us to do what we can\'t do by direct effort."'

          name: 'Solitude',
          description: 'Time alone with God, away from noise and distraction',
          howTo: 'Schedule regular time (even 15 minutes) to be alone with no phone, no people, no agenda—just you and God.',
          why: 'Solitude silences the competing voices in your life so you can hear God\'s voice more clearly.'

          name: 'Silence',
          description: 'Quieting your words and your mind to listen to God',
          howTo: 'Spend time in silence during prayer, without speaking, singing, or even thinking loudly. Just be.',
          why: 'In silence, we learn to listen instead of always talking. God often speaks in whispers, not shouts.'

          name: 'Fasting',
          description: 'Abstaining from food (or other things) for spiritual focus',
          howTo: 'Start small—skip one meal and use that time to pray. Or fast from social media, TV, or other distractions.',
          why: 'Fasting reminds us that we don\'t live on bread alone. It weakens the power of our physical appetites and strengthens our spiritual hunger.'

          howTo: 'Confess sin to God immediately. Share struggles with a trusted friend or mentor for accountability.',
          why: 'Confession brings sin into the light where it loses its power. It keeps short accounts with God and others.'
